# <font size=6>Welcome to Lexing Zhang's homepage!</font>

Welcome to Lexing Zhang's homepage!

I am currently a Master student at the University of Minnesota, College of Science and Engineering, Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo-Engineering, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/mlevin/home?authuser=0">Prof. Michael Levin</a>. I received my Bachelor’s degree from Chang’an University, where I majored in Transportation Engineering and was advised by <a href="https://js.chd.edu.cn/ysgcxy/wwx2/list.htm">Prof. Wenxuan Wang</a>. During my senior year, I was an exchange student at the National University of Singapore.

My current research focuses on optimization and transportation networks, with particular interest in the application of optimization, graph theory and control theory to traffic systems.

If you are interested in my research areas, I welcome any discussions and potential collaborations.

**Research Interests:**
- Optimization methods
- Transportation networks
- Graph theory
- Control theory
- Traffic network control
